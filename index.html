                        Hi, how are you? You’re doing okay, right?
                        I just want to say that I will never forget our beautiful moments.
                        The way you used to call my name — ah, that moment.
                        The sound of your laughter when something was funny, I really loved it.
                        And the way you always fell asleep suddenly — I thought it was really cute.
                        I truly wanted to hug you when you fell asleep like that.
                        Those moments are treasures that I will carry forever.
                        <span class="message-highlight">Thank you for giving me memories I will cherish for a lifetime.</span>

                    <h3>What I Wish I Could Say 💔</h3>
                    <p>
                        There are times when I wish everything had been different.
                        I think about all my mistakes that disappointed you and wonder what if.
                        But all of that is just regret that comes when everything is already gone,
                        and no matter how many times I apologize, it will never erase all the pain I caused you.

                        Even so, I will still apologize for all the pain you went through.
                        I’m sorry that back then I couldn’t be a good partner for you.
                        But I think you’ve already found someone who can give you everything I couldn’t,
                        and I’m happy if he can make you happy — unlike me, who only caused you suffering.

                        I hope you know that I never meant to hurt you the way you did when you were with me.
                        I just wanted to learn how to be a good partner for the person I loved,
                        but it seems I couldn’t become that person.

                        I’ve learned that some people come into our lives not to stay,
                        but to teach us what love, loss, and letting go truly mean.
                        You taught me that, and I’m grateful — even though it hurts.

                        Do you remember when I said you were my first love?
                        You couldn’t easily believe words like that,
                        but you were truly the first person with whom I ever felt a love story in my life.
                        And I’m very grateful that you were that person.

                        Thank you for being the best part of my life,
                        and I’m sorry for ever being the worst part of yours.
                        I will never regret this meeting, because it was the greatest happiness of my life
                        to have once been someone you loved with all of who you were.
                        I truly loved that.

                        Being an important part of someone’s life makes me proud —
                        especially when that person was you.

                        You know, I really miss the moments when we were together:
                        eating together, sleeping together, and doing everything we could together.
                        Thank you for accompanying me while I was working.
                        I never thought there would be someone who would always stay with me during moments like that.

                        I also never thought I would have someone I could call “home,”
                        because when I was tired, that person was always there for me.
                        Hehe, thank you for that.

                        We went through happy times and unhappy times,
                        laughed and cried together — we went through all of that together.
                        I really loved those moments, but I couldn’t keep them.

                        I’m sorry for ever being a bad partner and not being enough for you.
                        But even so, my love for you will always be there and it is real.
                        And if he says, “I love you,”
                        then he still doesn’t know that my love for you could surpass anything.

                        Hey, sometimes I cry like a little child when I remember the way you called my name — that voice.
                        And I don’t even know why I dream about you sending me messages.
                        When I wake up and check my phone, I realize it was only a dream,
                        and I feel like crying again.

                        I truly feel like I’ve lost someone incredibly precious in my life —
                        someone who made every day of mine more enjoyable.

                        Sometimes I really want to message you just to ask how you are,
                        but I feel like I’m no longer worthy of doing that because of everything I did to you.
                        Even though I always want to talk and share stories with you,
                        like asking, “Are you still upset about when my friend bothered you?”

                        But then I realize that I’m no longer someone special to you.
                        I’m no longer someone you need.
                        Now, you don’t have to overthink anymore —
                        whether I exist or not doesn’t matter to you,
                        because I don’t mean anything anymore.

                        Even if I were gone, no one would care.

                        Even so, you will always be my favorite and special person in my life,
                        because no one has ever been able to replace you since then.

                        Please never give up or feel sad, okay?
                        I’m always praying for the best for you from here.
                        And I want to say that I miss you very much and I still love you deeply,
                        but I will keep these feelings quietly to myself.
                        I’m sorry for expressing my feelings here.

                        Today is your day, and I truly hope it’s everything you dreamed of.
                        You deserve all the happiness in the world —
                        someone who sees your worth, appreciates your uniqueness,
                        and loves you the way you deserve to be loved.

                        Don’t worry about people speaking badly about us;
                        they’ll eventually realize that what they say isn’t true.
                        Live your life as usual, okay?

                        Even though we’re not together,
                        a part of me will always support you.
